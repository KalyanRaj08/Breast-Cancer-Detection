BREAST CANCER DETECTION

ABOUT THE PROJECT:
Using machine learning to find whether a cell is malignent or benign with the descriptions of the cell available in a dataset. A malignent cell doesnt have cancer but a benign cell is dangerous. For this the datasheet is downloaded from kraggle. The total 570 data split into 3 for training, validating and testing of the data. After this training the code will be able to detect a cell whether it is malignent or benign with a accuracy of 97%.

INSTRUCTION:
1. The .ipynb sheet is attached with the question and answer respectively.
2. Open the ipynb file in anaconda or google colab.
3. The machine learning concept is applied with python coding which is visible when each line of the code is ran individually.
